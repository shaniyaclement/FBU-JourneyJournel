### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Social Networking/ Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** Journey Journal will be primarily developed for android mobile devices, but can have limited computer functionality. The mobile version will allow user to take images through the camera to upload, whereas with a computer the user would only be able to upload what is currently downloaded for example.
- **Story:** Provides a safe space for indivduals finding themselves and using journaling as a guide to self discovery to connect. Strips away the societal pressures of being perfect and allows the user to just be.
- **Market:** The app is marketed towards individual who enhoy journaling documenting their journey's in images; however, anyone can use the application.
- **Habit:** Journey Journal will encourage users to utilize the app daily/ weekly to track their experiences, track their goal progress, and engage with user content.
- **Scope:** Start with allowing the user to journal and set goals within the application. Next add the content sharing aspect. Then connect their calendars to the app so we can send reminders throughout the day to the user. Maybe later adding the ability to buy journal templates.
